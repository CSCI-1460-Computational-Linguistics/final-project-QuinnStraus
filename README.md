My submission should run top-to-bottom with the only required data being the provided dataset stored at drive/My Drive/Copy of student.pkl - this is used in the load block near the top

The get_roberta_embeddings and get_lda_topics functions also store the outputs arrays as in csv format for reuse later, but it is not necessary to have the csv files to run the code. 

The whole codebase takes about 90 minutes to run (40 minutes for roberta embeddings, 40 minutes for the full main function, 6 minutes to train the LDA model and a couple more minutes for the rest).

Thanks for teaching us this semester!
